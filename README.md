Hello Shippers and welcome to Ministry Mare Twilights Secret Shipping Stable: The Fan Made Expansion! This is an
expansion pack for TSSSF-TCG based on the hugely popular Fallout: Equestria. All the cards have been produced
using the public card templates provided by the wonderful pikel-prisim. In this expansion, you will find a wooping
123 brand new cards based on the stories Fallout: Equestria, Project Horizons, Heros, Murky Number 7, and Anywhere But
Here! There are 73 new pony cards, and 25 each of ship and goal cards.

However, this project is just a side project for me, and I could really do with some help! Particularily in the area
or artists. I would also be plenty greatful if anyone would be willing to create a custom expansion for the Vassel
version of TSSSF so that I can playtest without having to get multiple sets of the cards printed.

Thank you for reading, and happy shipping! Now, have a silly back story that does a terrible job of explaining how our
favourite pony author ended up in the irradiated world of Fallout: Equestria.

When the world died, everypony thought that the fabled Ministry Mares died with it. But at least one survived. When the
bombs fell and the citied of the world were engulfed in hell fire, Twilight Sparkle, the greatest author (and best
student!) of her age, fled with all her works into the hills of Equestria. She took up resedence in a secret Stable
with the numbers "69" emblasoned on the great gear shapped door. There, she put herself into stasis and awated the
future, when her genius for writing could be truly appreciated. Now, 200 years later, Twilight has awoken and
beheld through her many camara feeds a blasted and dead world, but one where ponies roamed still. With the assistance
of her robot companion SP1.KE, Twilight is just begining to discover a new world full of opportunity, and filled with
plenty of new victims.
